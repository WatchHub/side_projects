<p><b><font size="5"><a name="what">What is QuickRoutine</a> all about?</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>QuickRoutine</b> is  very user-friendly software to help you making 
a class routine for all the batches' of a semester. Providing all necessary information it will give 
you a complete class routine <a href="#Constraints">automatically</a> of all the current batches, teachers 
and rooms. If you have any experience of making class routine by hand then you 
must know that necessary information to make a semester's full class routine is available 
<a href="#room">rooms</a>, existing <a href="#batch">batches</a>, available 
<a href="#teacher">teachers</a> and all <a href="#course">courses information</a> of 
current semester. To give you full control of generating routine you can make 
part or full of the routine <a href="#manual">manually</a> with the help of <b>QuickRoutine</b> and let 
<b>QuickRoutine</b> 
generate the rest <a href="#Constraints">automatically</a>. Note that <b>QuickRoutine</b> 
doesn't generate lab course's routine 
<a href="#Constraints">automatically</a>. So you need to assign all lab courses' classes
<a href="#manual">manually</a>.  </p>

<p><font size="5"><b>How to <a name="start">start</a></b></font><b><font size="5">?</font></b></p>
<p>To create a new routine click <b>File </b>on the menu bar and click <b>New.
</b>During create a new routine<b> - </b>enter the number of semesters per year 
of your university. Enter maximum sections of a semester. Then you have to 
provide all <a href="#room">rooms</a>, <a href="#batch">batches</a>,
<a href="#teacher">teachers</a> and <a href="#course">course</a> information. 
After providing this basic information you can make part or full of your class 
routine <a href="#manual">manually</a> with the help of full graphical interface 
of <b>QuickRoutine</b>. As we have found that lab course's routine requires a 
lot more information available to know the user intention of lab class routine 
and this varies from department to department, we have leaved this job to user 
to
<a href="#manual">manually</a> assign those classes. You can also assign classes 
<a href="#manual">manually</a> for theory classes. After inserting all of this 
information click on <b>Generate Automatic Routine</b> button of the main 
<a href="#edit">editor</a>. Now click on the left sides' tree of the main <a href="#edit">
editor</a> to view the routine. You can

<p>Click <b>Insert</b> on menu bar and then click <b>Room Information</b>. You 
need to provide a room ID. A sample room ID is '309A'. Room ID should be small for 
keeping your routine looks slim. Room description is must for lab room cause 
<b>QuickRoutine</b> <b>1.1</b> does not assign class automatically to lab rooms. So 
you always need to assign 
class to lab room <a href="#manual">manually</a>. And you will find it helpful to have a brief 
description of room during assigning a class. A sample description is 'Network lab'. If 
you don't have a room available for fulltime you can let it know <b>QuickRoutine</b> by inserting 
session. To know more about session <a href="#session">click here</a>. Please 
note that <b>QuickRoutine 1.1 </b>assign theory classes to theory room. Neither 
lab courses nor lab rooms are handled automatically by <b>QuickRoutine 1.1. </b>
If you need any theory courses' class need to assign to any lab class please do 
it <a href="#manual">manually</a>.</p>

<p><b><font size="5">How to <a name="batch">insert batches</a>?</font></b></p>
<p>Click <b>Insert</b> on menu bar and then click <b>Batch Information</b>. 
Insert all batches of current semester. You may find it new to insert the
<a href="#Sunday Morning">&quot;class start at&quot;</a> attribute of a batch. It is a
<a href="#Sunday Morning">routine style</a> of a batch. Only two
<a href="#Sunday Morning">routine style</a> is available for version 1.1. If you 
have more idea please write to us at
<a href="mailto:tojewel@hotmail.com?subject=I have a new idea about routine style.">tojewel@hotmail.com</a> with full explanation. If you don't find 
required semester or section, remember that you enter maximum semester and 
maximum section during <a href="#start">create a new routine</a>. You can also bias a batch's 
routine style by inserting <a href="#session">session</a> of a batch. For example if batch: 1/1-B doesn't want 
to attain any classes at 1:00 pm, set those <a href="#session">sessions</a> <b>Busy.
QuickRoutine</b>
will take this account during making a <a href="#Constraints">automatic</a> 
routine and let it know during assign a class manually of that batch.</p>

<p><b><font size="5">How to <a name="teacher">insert teachers</a>?</font></b></p>
<p>Click <b>Insert</b> on menu bar and then click <b>Teacher Information</b>. A 
teachers' ID is must. Teacher ID can be formed with first letters of his/her 
names' word. For example Muhammad Zafar Iqbal can be identified with a ID: MZI. If you have a part time teacher and want <b>QuickRoutine</b> to 
assign class for that teacher at allowed time, inert this information by 
<a href="#session">session</a> 
panel. For example you have a teacher only for Sunday and Monday vacant, set 
Sunday and Monday <b>Free</b> and all other day <b>Busy</b>. Please be clear 
that what is <a href="#session">session for a teacher</a>.</p>

<p><b><font size="5">How to <a name="course">insert courses</a>?</font></b></p>
<p>Click <b>Insert</b> on menu bar and then click <b>Course Information</b>. All 
course ID must have to be distinct. If you have same course ID for theory and 
lab then you can add a 'L' after the lab course ID. For example CSE-100 is a 
theory course ID and CSE-100L is corresponding lab course ID. Same course ID for 
different section can be identified as CSE-123A, CSE-123B and so on. Before 
inserting a course you must have corresponding <a href="#batch">batch information</a> available. If 
you keep a <a href="#teacher">course teacher</a> 'Assign Later', <b>QuickRoutine</b> will not generate 
<a href="#Constraints">automatic</a> classes for this course. Please don't think too much about course room. 
Just let it be 'Assign Later' for now. We think all theory class's duration should 
be 1 hour long. If you have an exception please insert that course as a lab-course.</p>

example you want a newly married teacher's class should be started always at 10 
am. So <a href="#teacher">insert that teacher's</a> data setting all 8

<p><b><font size="5">What is a routine <a name="Report">report</a>?</font></b></p>
<p>As we experienced that making a class routine is just 
handling a big amount of data. So you always want to know that whether all 
of the classes of all of the courses have <a href="#Constraints">assigned 
perfectly</a>. A report can provide you this information. As you have to assign 
all lab courses <a href="#manual">manually</a> so check always the lab routine 
report to know if there is any lab class left to assign? Check also automatic 
routine report always cause though <b>QuickRoutine</b> must pick a routine under 
some <a href="#Constraints">constraints</a> but it may fail to assign classes to 
some of the theory classes if there is lack of class rooms' or teachers' free
<a href="#session">session</a> or if it violate any of the
<a href="#Constraints">constraints</a> of automatic routine generating 
algorithm. </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#home">Home</a></p>
<hr color="#000000" size="1">
<p><b><font size="5">What are the <a name="Constraints">constraints of automatic routine</a> generating algorithm?</font></b></p>
<p>During generating automatic routine <b>QuickRoutine</b> must generate 
the best possible routine without violating some constraints. For example <b>
QuickRoutine</b> will not assign more than one class of a course on a same day. 
To assign a class on a day it requires a period at which the batch and the 
teacher is <a href="#session">free</a> and a <a href="#session">free</a> theory 
room is available at that periods. Of course you can assign more than one 
classes of a course <a href="#manual">manually</a>. So that it is very important 
to check the both automatic and manual routine <a href="#Report">report</a> 
always. Because automatic routine report will let you know that how much classes 
is not possible to assign for not violating this constraints of a routine. </p>

<p><b><font size="5">What does it means &quot;Class Start at <a name="Sunday Morning">
Sunday Morning</a>&quot;?</font></b></p>
<p>It means that a <a href="#batch">batch's</a> class will start on Sunday at morning and continue 
until lunch. On Monday day that batch's class will be started after lunch and 
continue until evening and on Tuesday that batch's class will be started at 
morning again and so on. If you enter the class style &quot;Sunday Evening&quot; for a 
batch that batch's class will be started on Sunday at evening and on Monday at 
morning and so on. If you follow this class style it will give students a 
consecutive class everyday, so that a regular student can save the wasted time between two 
classes and a student who have a drop course can participate his/her drop 
classes. Of course this is just setting a priority. <b>QuickRoutine</b> will try 
best to maintain this style. This excellent idea is given to us by Dr. Kabir 
Hossain, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Statistics, Shahjalal University of 
Science and Technology.</p>

<p>At first we thought that a weak is enough to write a automatic routine 
generating software. But it takes almost a month to complete! 
We tried our best to keep this software bug free, user-friendly and intelligent. 
Many people around us helps a lot by giving their ideas to make this perfect. 
Thanks to all of them. But we know that we are still missing a lot more people 
who can give us more ideas or recognize a critical bug and/or limitation. 
Actually I am talking about you. Any kind of suggestions/comments will be appreciated. Write 
to us at:
